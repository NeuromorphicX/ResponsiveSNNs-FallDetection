## üîç Abstract

Fall detection systems, essential for the safety of elderly individuals, have increasingly incorporated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for improved accuracy. However, real-time processing‚Äîespecially on resource-constrained wearable devices‚Äîremains a challenge due to the computational demands of DNNs.

Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown promise for improving energy efficiency in fall detection. Yet, their potential to leverage **temporal dynamics** for faster responsiveness has not been fully explored.

This work proposes:

- **Quick Spike Encoding (QSE):** An encoding method that prioritizes critical inputs based on amplitude over time.
- **Linear Weighted Mean Squared Error Count (LW-MSEC) Loss Function:** A loss function that emphasizes early detection by penalizing early-stage errors more heavily.

Evaluations on two fall detection datasets show significant improvements:
- **91% accuracy in just 10 time steps** on SisFall (vs 25 steps in standard baselines)
- **Over 60% improvement in responsiveness**
